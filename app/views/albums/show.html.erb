<h1> JOHN KASMIN, New York, Sept.13th 2017 </h1>

       <blockquote>“I’m in NYC for my book signing,” he said with his welcoming and genuine British accent. He handed me his business card - “It would be lovely to see you there.” "J.Kasmin," I read. “What does the J. stand for?” I asked him. “Call me Kas, everyone calls me Kas or Kasmin.” Kas it is. </br>
        <br>
        Kas found himself confused in the fashion circus outside of the Marc Jacobs runway when I bumped into him. He was perfect to me standing there hands folded on his back, his eyes wandering curiously around. I could just picture all the thoughts going through his mind witnessing the bonkers crowds outside of Park Avenue Armory like it was the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro. A woman wearing a hat that could house half of Manhattan, walking back and forth over the sidewalk like there was no exit on either side, waiting for photographers to spot her. Another woman with yellow hair speaking into her phone on and off, while you could ask yourself if there really was someone on the other line. </br>
        <br>
        We spoke for a little while about Norway and categorically its sumptuous fjords, then the fashion industry as he happened to be related to a top model known for her androgynity and childish blue eyes. Victim of the fashion circus myself, it took me a few hours to calm down and connect the dots to the Paul Kasmin gallery, which was confirmed by his follow-up email for his book signing. A gallery I have admired from the other side of the pond representing artists and photographers whose ways and style I connect to, and certainly admire.</br>

        Fast forward, Paris, ten days later. I had finally made it to the David Hockney exhibit at Pompidou - an artist whose work I simply love to bits. I cherish colours, the triggering of subtle emotions, and pieces that doesn’t push the eye and mind of the beholder to over-intellectualise the piece in front of him/her. Being a vivid follower of the portfolio-career movement, Hockney is furthermore to me a prescriptor of this in the artistic world, working across genres and techniques. He always experimented, and famously excelled. I arrived to his polaroid collage-period, which I was unfamiliar too. It was 22.06, I was almost alone at the Pompidou, and I suddenly stopped in front of the kind and familiar look of Hockney’s subject. "I know this man," I thought to myself. It was Kas. <strong>Kasmin, Los Angeles, 12th March 1982</strong>, it stated. Little did I know when I met Kas the wandering wonderer on the streets of NY, that he was close to Hockney, and helped him kickstart his brilliant career. <br></br> I walked home, in awe, more inspired than ever.
